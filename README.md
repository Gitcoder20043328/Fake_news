# 📰 Fake News Detection (AI/ML Internship Project)

A simple machine learning project to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using text data and Logistic Regression.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Joblib (model saving)

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Fake and Real News](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` merged with labels (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)

## ✅ Steps
1. Data loading and labeling
2. TF-IDF vectorization
3. Train/test split
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
6. Model saved as `model.pkl`
